Web Project 2

Overview

This project has a mix of animations and BEM file structure. It showcases the simplicity and beauty of CSS & Animations. This project required BEM file structure, CSS animiations, and iFrame video container.

Web Project 2 shows the different ways tables, shapes, and containers are using using adaptive web design. Starting from header with an animation that is also used for another image. This project showcases the different ways you can transform using animation with CSS. The use of iFrames inside its own container to overlay on top of the next container. My plans for this project is to fully understand and learn the technologies to enhance my future projects.
